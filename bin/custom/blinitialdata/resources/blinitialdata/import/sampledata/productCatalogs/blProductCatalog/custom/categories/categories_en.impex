               ;;dslr-cameras;"<h1>A Fast and Easy Way to Rent DSLR Cameras</h1>
<p>Professional photographers, serious hobbyists, and those who value high quality images, proven performance, and the broadest selection of native lenses choose DSLR cameras. These Digital Single-Lens Reflex (DSLR) systems are tried and true performers that deliver great image quality, especially in challenging, low-light conditions.

               ;;macro;"<h1>Rent Macro Lenses to Take Incredible Close-Ups</h1>
<p>The right macro lens gives photographers a way to capture amazing close-ups. With an ability to shoot 1:2 or 1:1 magnification ratios, macro lenses offer great flexibility to shoot amazing imagery not only up close but also from a distance for portrait photography. Some even work for time lapse and video projects, too.</p>
<h2>How Macro Works</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re looking at the specs of one of our rental macro lenses, you may notice a magnification factor, such as 1:1. You&rsquo;ll also sometimes see it written as 1x. This is because some manufacturers show the magnification factor as a ratio (1:1, 1:2) while some use decimals (.25x, .22x). A ratio of, say, 1:4 is the same as 0.25x &ndash; you can think of ratios as fractions (instead of 1:4, think &frac14;).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to convert one to another? Say a lens is listed at 0.19x. Take 1 divided by 0.19 and get 5.26. That lens has a magnification ratio of 1:5.26, which means the objects it photographs are approximately 5 times larger in real life than what will be projected on the sensor. This is a simplification, as other factors are involved such as sensor size, object distance, and overall object size but this at least gets you started in thinking in macro terms. Conversely, a lens with a 5:1 ratio can project an image five times the size of the object.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if it&rsquo;s a true macro lens you&rsquo;ll see a magnification ratio of 1:1 or higher. For standard lenses, you&rsquo;ll more often see this spec written as a decimal. This is what sets macro lenses apart from regular lenses: a macro lens has the ability to focus from infinity to 1:1 magnification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like regular lenses, macro lenses come in a wide variety of focal lengths. The longer your focal length, the further you need to be from your subject. A 100mm macro lens will be at twice the working distance of a 50mm macro lens, meaning you have to be twice as far from your subject. Why this matters is that some subjects, especially when shooting insects and other animals, are more skittish than others and may be frightened away by you. The further you can be from them when shooting, the better.</p>
<p>At BorrowLenses, we rent an extensive variety of lenses in the macro category, including Sony macro lenses, Canon macro lenses, Nikon micro lenses (their version of &ldquo;macro&rdquo;), and so many more.</p>

               ;;super-telephoto;"<h1>Take Super Close-Up Shots with a Super Telephoto Lens Rental</h1>
<p>When you need to get close to subjects far away or very small, you need a super telephoto lens. Today&rsquo;s lenses from top manufacturers like Canon, Nikon, Sony, and more produce the highest-quality images, capturing amazing detail with many delivering astounding images even for subjects in motion. Great for wildlife and sporting events, the only downside to these lenses for many professionals and amateurs alike is their cost. BorrowLenses eliminates this barrier, making it possible to rent a telephoto lens without a big investment.</p>
<h2>Rent the Super Telephoto Lens You Need Here</h2>
<p>Regardless of whether photography is your hobby or career, a standard telephoto lens is often the second lens purchased. With some zoom capability often up to 200 mm, it gives adequate zoom for most regular use. The super telephoto lens, which zooms to 300mm, 400mm, or higher, however, may only be needed occasionally. This sometimes makes the investment impractical, especially at the rate new lens models continue to evolve today!</p>
<p>At BorrowLenses, photographers and videographers of every skill level and need can find top quality super telephoto lenses for their favorite camera brands. Some of our most popular super telephoto lens rentals are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM Lens</strong>. Made for full- and crop-frame sensors with a weather-resistant barrel, this lens is a highly popular choice for photographers shooting outdoors. For crop-frame sensor cameras, the focal length runs from 160 to 640 mm. This lens offers compatibility with select Canon extenders to get even closer with every shot.</li>
<li><strong>Nikon AF-S 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR Lens</strong>. Nikon&rsquo;s new Vibration Reduction (VR) system limits image blur due to camera shake. The Silent Wave AF feature delivers quiet focusing, making it an ideal lens for shooting video or in nature where silence is essential.</li>
<li><strong>Sony FE 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6 GM OSS Lens</strong>. Another excellent lens for photo and video, it offers a Focus Range Limiter feature for the capture of moving subjects and a Direct Drive Super Sonic Wave Motor AF for fast, precise &ndash; and quiet! &ndash; autofocus.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these three popular lenses, photographers can find super telephoto lenses from Tamron, Fuji, Panasonic and Sigma. Astrophotographers can also find the zoom they need with the Celestron NexStar 6SE 1500mm Telescope.</p>

               ;;tilt-shift;"<p>Do you need a tilt-shift lens? Photographers can use special perspective-control tools to achieve the most lifelike imagery of buildings and other open spaces. Tilt-shift lenses are ideal for architectural, portrait and landscape photography. Of course, they have other uses as well. If you need to rent tilt-shift lenses, BorrowLenses has a great selection to check out. Canon and Nikon produce the most common tilt-shift lenses. All tilt-shift lenses have the same basic controls and functions. You can tilt and/or shift the lens relative to the fixed plane of the camera√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sensor. Learn more in <a href='https://www.borrowlenses.com/blog/tiltshift-working-with-perspective-control-lenses-part-1/' target='_blank'>Tilt-Shift Lenses for Beginners</a>.</p>

<h2>Tilt-Shift Photography </h2>

<p>Tilt-shift lenses have the ability to make tall buildings appear straight with a shift. The shift function allows the lens to be moved (shifted) left or right and always remain parallel to the camera√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s sensor plane. Tilt-shift photography additionally has the ability to produce the miniature effect, which is making a real-life scene such as a stadium or city street appear as if it were a small toy model. The reason a scene can look like a miniature with tilt-shift lenses is because the plane of focus is so narrow and both the foreground and the background are out of focus. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not something the human eye is used to seeing and we interpret images like this differently. This is known as the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdiorama effect√¢‚Ç¨≈ì. This effect is truly extraordinary. If this sounds like fun to you or if you need such a lens for a project, you can rent tilt-shift lenses from BorrowLenses easily and conveniently. Additionally, renting allows you to try a lens at an affordable rate before you go to the store and purchase it.</p>

<h2>Endless Possibilities </h2>

<p>Renting is a great way to have the opportunity to try a variety of different lenses that are high tech and up to date. Renting a lens when you need it instead of buying can save you money. If you want to give tilt-shift photography a try or if you are looking to rent tilt-shift lenses, BorrowLenses offers a variety of rentals just for you.  </p>"

               ;;fisheye;"<h2>What is a Fisheye Lens?</h2>

<p>Fisheye lenses, also called a curvilinear lenses, are generally only found at the shortest focal lengths (typically less than 15mm) and create an almost circular image with a field of view that can reach 180 degrees. Pictures taken with fisheye lenses often look like everything is getting pulled into the middle of the frame. Fisheye lenses were originally created to photograph the sky and they still excel at that. Similarly, fisheye lenses do a great job of capturing underwater scenes (will require <a href='https://www.borrowlenses.com/category/underwater' target='_blank'>underwater housings</a> to do so). Shooting up or down tall buildings with a fisheye can create a feeling of vertigo. The curved edges of a frame can create a sense of motion in the right image. Ordinary scenes and objects will look new and interesting with a fisheye lens!</p>

<h2>Efficient Cost-Saving Strategies</h2>

<p>Both student filmmakers and small production companies will find that their range of possibilities opens right up with rental lens options. Planning out shooting days can expedite things even further by reducing the number of simultaneous rentals, and all it takes is the right shooting schedule for your script. By grouping scenes according to the cinema lens sizes and specs needed, your production can:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Streamline shooting by reducing the need for camera reconfiguration</li>
    <li>Maximize effective shooting time while minimizing simultaneous rentals</li>
    <li>Set up overlapping delivery/return dates to ensure you are always holding the lenses you need for a day's shooting</li>

<h2>Perfection in Every Shot</h2>

<p>Shooting quality motion pictures on your DSLR is a matter of technique and proper support from the equipment.

The more pro-active choice is to rent cine lenses, so your best work moves forward, no matter what stage your equipment development is currently in. That way, you are able to film on a level that reflects your skill, not your budget.</p>"

               ;;dollies_sliders;"<h1>Rent Camera Sliders</h1>
<p>Sliders have been such essential tools to create beautiful moves from side to side or in and out without needing a huge track and a heavy dolly for a fraction of the cost. You can easily recreate very similar moves as dollies and come in various sizes for any production need.</p>
<p>A drawback from most sliders is that they are only 2-4&rsquo; long which can be difficult to use on long shots. Works great for short clips though. A premium feature found on many cameras sliders is an integrated motor. Motorized sliders guarantee precision and smoothness when sliding your camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a camera slider you have your sights on purchasing, with BorrowLenses you can try out all kinds of sliders, before you buy, ensuring you&rsquo;re thrilled with the gear you add to your kit. In additional to sliders, BorrowLenses also provides <a href='https://www.borrowlenses.com/category/cameras'>camera rentals</a>, lens rentals, and support gear.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Renting Dollies and Sliders for Photography</h2>
<p>Though most often used for videography, some sliders are essential for unique time lapse - as well as motion lapse - photography projects. Create dynamic 2 and 3-axis movements, whether it's for stars, people, or clouds &ndash;&nbsp;you can get stunning motion and time-lapse footage immediately.</p>
<h2>Rent the Slider That&rsquo;s Right for You</h2>
<p>Syrp and Rhino are the big names in the industry. BorrowLenses carries plenty of these popular sliders. Our sliders rental options include:</p>
<p>- <strong>Rhino EVO Pro Slider Bundle 42-Inch </strong>The Rhino EVO Pro Slider Bundle 42' is a stainless steel rails and motorized pan head kit that includes shutter release cables for Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, and Sony. With the motion controller, you can quickly program a move with in and out points, time of travel, ramping, and looping. This bundle is ideal for time-lapse shooters, interviews, narrative films, and documentary crews.</p>
<p>- <strong>Syrp Magic Carpet PRO 3&rsquo; Slider Kit </strong>The Syrp Magic Carpet PRO 3' Slider Kit is a professional, portable slider system for smooth tracking shots. A weighted flywheel and breaking carriage allows complete control over your sliding motion.With a payload of up to 70 lbs, this slider can handle a wide variety of cinema cameras and camcorders. The Syrp Magic Carpet PRO 3' Slider Kit is ideal for both narrative and documentary filmmaking, as well as for time lapse photography.</p>
<p>- <strong>Syrp Genie II Motion Control Time Lapse Kit </strong>The Syrp Genie II Motion Control Time Lapse Kit is the ultimate creative movement tool that consists of a Genie II motorized pan/tilt head and a Genie II Linear slider attachment with a 10' Genie rope. Together, you can slide, pan, and tilt for unique tracking shots or time-lapses. The pan/tilt head as built-in software for basic shots. For more complex moves, connect and control everything via the Syrp app.</p>
<h2>Can I Rent a Camera Slider?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Absolutely! You can rent a Kessler 3&rsquo; Cineslider for as little as $8 a day, for 3-90 days. Most camera sliders are very easy to assemble and operate. The main purpose of a slider is to create some movement to your shot instead of leaving it still. Having your shot still can make your shot boring and stale. Adding motion to your shots can elevate your production value.</p>
<h2>Get the Most from Your Slider Rental with All The Right Gear for the Job</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen the Slider that fits your precise purpose, check out our selection <a href='https://www.borrowlenses.com/camera-accessories'>camera accessories</a> such as attachments, extra batteries, and kits to help you have the perfect shoot without breaking the bank.</p>
<h2>Equipment Rental Advantages</h2>
<p>If you need to use something one time, you can keep money in your wallet by renting the item at an affordable rate rather that purchasing it at full price. In fact, in some cases, you may be able to rent the same item numerous times without even spending the amount of the purchase price. Renting allows you to see if you like a product before you buy it. It is much easier to spend a smaller amount on a rental, only to realize you don't like the item, than to buy it at a higher price and realize the same.</p>
<p><h2>What are Sliders and Dollies Used For?</h2></p>
<p>Having a slider or dolly will add so much production value and emotion to your films. Sliders and dollies create motion from side to side and back forth to add emotion to your footage. When a character is talking about something serious on camera, add a sliding move going forward to really feel what the character is going through. When establishing a scene, add a motion from left to right to introduce the scene.</p>"

    <li>Field Monitors: Typically larger than on-camera monitors but often smaller than production monitors, field monitors allow you to easily view imagery anywhere and have a variety of inputs.

               ;;follow_focus;"<h2>Get Lens Support</h2>

<p>One of the most important factors of a successful photograph is its focus. While amateur photographers may be happy with their camera's autofocus feature, professionals and perfectionists need to manually set up their lens for optimum focus. Manually focusing on your subject gives you much more control and variety in your frame. It does, however, require more practice, more skill and support for your high powered lenses. At BorrowLenses, you can find lens support rentals, such as follow focus, that can help you achieve the results you need.</p>

<h2>Have Greater Control</h2>

<p>The more you maintain control of the parts of your camera, the more satisfied you can be with the outcome. Taking the time to use a specific lens, set up a shutter speed and narrow in on an intricate scene can help you get a better picture.

               ;;memory_cards_storage;"<h2>Different Kinds of Storage </h2>

<p>What do you need in a memory card? There are a few different varieties available, which we help define below.</p>

<ul>
    <li>SD: Secure Digital cards are probably the most common type of memory card. The two most common varieties are the older SDHC, which support capacities up to 32GB, and SDXC which support capacities up to 2TB. Both can be found in UHS-I with speeds up to 104 MB/s. Newer cards will often be UHS-II with speeds up to 312 MB/s. Video Speed Class SD cards will have write speeds no slower than 90 MB/s.

    <li>microSD: These are miniaturized versions of SD cards. They can be used in regular SD card slots and readers if you use an adapter. They can be found in capacities up to 128 MB/s and are common in phones and action cameras.</li>
    <li>CF: CompactFlash cards bigger than SD cards. They used to be the standard for high capacity requirements but increasingly SSDs are being used for this purpose. CF cards support capacities up to 128 GB.</li>
    <li>CFast: CompactFast cards are a variant of CompactFlash cards but the two are not interchangeable. CFast cards are found in some video cameras and professional DSLRs. They support higher max transfer rates (up to 600 MB/s vs 167 MB/s). They also can better handle fast frame rate shooting.</li>
   <li>SSDs: We're used to thinking of Solid State Drives in reference to things like laptops but they are increasingly useful in the video recording industry. They support high capacities and high speeds. A 2.5' form factor is the most common, though you'll find SSDs in a variety of chassis types.</li>

               ;;gimbals-stabilizers
               ;;flashes-and-on-camera;"<p>If you are just starting out in the world of flash photography, knowing where to start may seem a little confusing, but once you know exactly what the flash does, you will be able to make more informed decisions about your equipment.</p>

<h2>Flash Efficiency Depends on Your Distance From Your Subject</h2>

<p>If you stand too far from your subject, the flash simply won't work. Of course, 'too far' is dependent solely on the type of flash you're using. Some are made only for very short distances, but others are created to work from much further away.</p>

<h2>The Guide Number Is Important</h2>

<p>The electronic flash you use with your camera will come with its own guide number. This number provides information about the flash's maximum output in relation to aperture and distance. In its most basic form, the higher the flash's guide number, the further you can be from your subject and still have good flash photography.</p>

<h2>Using a Flash Bracket Has Advantages</h2>

<p>When you use a flash bracket, the flash is further from the lens, which gets rid of nearly any chance of red-eye when you are photographing people. Most flash brackets also pivot, which allows them to rotate when you shoot vertically. This creates a better shadow for your pictures.</p>

<h2>Determining Which Kind of Flash You Need</h2>

<p>When it comes to the type of flash you need, it depends not only on your camera, but the type of photographs you hope to shoot. It may take a few tries to find what works for you. Instead of purchasing a flash you may not light, use lighting equipment rental from BorrowLenses. You can rent camera flash options for Nikon, Canon and several other brands. </p>"
